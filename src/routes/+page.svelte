        <p class="text-xl max-w-[50ch">
            I'm Hugo Korte aka Hugos, a passionate software engineer and second-year bachelor student in computer science. My journey began with Java, where I discovered my love for programming. Since then, I have been continuously expanding my skills and knowledge.
            Frontend development is my primary focus, and I have hands-on experience with SvelteKit. I enjoy creating seamless user experiences and crafting elegant, responsive interfaces. I believe that good design, coupled with efficient code, can truly make a difference in the digital world.
            When I'm not programming, you can find me sipping on a cup of coffee, engaging in friendly gaming sessions, or exploring new technologies and frameworks. I am always eager to learn and adapt to the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering.
            I am currently seeking opportunities to apply my skills and contribute to exciting projects. If you are looking for a motivated and adaptable software engineer, let's connect and discuss how we can work together to bring innovative ideas to life.
